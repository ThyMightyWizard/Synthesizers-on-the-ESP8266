Since the DMA Engine has moved to ISR the code should look like


void ICACHE_RAM_ATTR onTimerISR(){ //Code needs to be in IRAM because its a ISR
while (!(i2s_is_full())) { //Donâ€™t block the ISR if the buffer is full
DAC=0x8000+sine[phase++];
//Pulse Density Modulated 16-bit I2S DAC
for (uint8_t i=0;i<32;i++) { 
  i2sACC=i2sACC<<1;
  if(DAC >= err) {
    i2sACC|=1;
    err += 0xFFFF-DAC;
  }
    else
  {
    err -= DAC;
  }
 }
 bool flag=i2s_write_sample(i2sACC);
}
timer1_write(2000);//Next in 2mS
}
